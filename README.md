# CSS Kitten Wheelbarrow

## Learning Goals

- Position elements absolutely

## Introduction

Oh no! All of our kittens have escaped from the wheelbarrow and we need to get
them back in. Help collect all the kittens and put them into the wheelbarrow
using CSS selectors and absolute positioning. 

## Position Elements Absolutely

There are a few different ways we can use CSS to position elements in our web
pages. _Absolute_ positioning means placing the element in its containing
element in a certain location that will stay the same no matter where other
elements are placed.

To get started with this lab, open index.html in the browser. (For students
using the Learn IDE, [use these
instructions](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/common-ide-questions/viewing-html-pages-in-the-learn-ide)
on how to view HTML pages in the browser.)

Use the comments in **css/place-kitty.css** to write the correct selectors to
move each kitty into the wheelbarrow.

## Conclusion

Sometimes it takes a little bit of time to get used to how absolute positioning
works, so don't worry if you have to practice. It will help you create more
complex CSS layouts in the future.
